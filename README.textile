Puts Google Reader on a margin diet, and puts some nice borders back in where you'd like them to be. See "here":https://skitch.com/cxlt/gee6q/google-reader-diet for a sample screenshot.

h2. Requirements

Google Chrome, or Greasemonkey on a browser that supports it. Probably doesn't work on IE <9.

Either of:

* "Click here.":https://github.com/clint-tseng/greader-diet/raw/master/greader-diet.user.js
* Download the .user.js userscript, and drag it onto Chrome to install it.

You can uninstall it on the extensions pane.
